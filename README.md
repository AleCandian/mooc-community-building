# Our Project: Building a Community around the Open Science MOOC
## Vision
"We work with a team of teachers at TU Delft to run a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) on Open Science. We want to design an engaging course that shows the participants the advantages of Open Science and motivate them to join and contribute to the Open Science movement."
